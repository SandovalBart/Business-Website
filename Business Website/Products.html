				<h2>Floating</h2>
			</header>
				<p>
					We offer 3 different lengths of floats throughout the course of the season. The first float that we offer through the year
					is a 7 mile long float. In which the floaters will go up river and then float down to the boat ramp where their cars are parked at. 
					There is a major thing that you must know is that while the float is kind of a longer float we only offer that float at the beginning
					of the season which is water level dependent. After the 7 mile float is a 3 1/2 mile float which is the same rules as the first float 
					except this float is one that we recommend if you have a younger child we like to tell parents about this float because it gives everyone 
					a quick little float that will be great for beginners. This float is also based on how high the water level is.
